# PROKEMON
**Group Name**: The Prokémon Masters

**Members**: Donald Bi, Hanson He

## Brief Description ##
We will be creating a Pokémon remake with some main features, mainly from Pokémon Emerald, using Processing. The game will include the player being able to walk around and explore the map, encounter wild Pokémon in grass, and also fight NPC trainers that have their own teams. Every Pokémon up to Generation 5 will be available to use through different datasets found online, and moves that don't have special conditions, such as Outrage that lasts for a few turns or TMs and egg moves, could also be learned.

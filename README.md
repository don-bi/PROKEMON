# PROKEMON
**Group Name**: The Prokémon Masters

**Members**: Donald Bi, Hanson He

## Brief Description ##
We will be creating a Pokémon remake with some main features, mainly from Pokémon Emerald, using Processing. The game will include the player walking around and exploring the map, encountering wild Pokémon in the grass, and fighting NPC trainers that have their own teams. Every Pokémon up to Generation 5 will be available to use and implemented through different datasets found online, and moves that don't have special conditions, such as solar beam that requires a few turns to use or TMs and egg moves that are learned differently, could also be learned through leveling.
